# Bejeweled Clone

##Purpose
It has a very large board, 7x7 but the game logic can scale to any sized board. This was one of the first bigger games that I developed, and the most complicated at the time of creation. Starting off as a simple Bejeweled clone it became something similar to Puzzle and Dragons. I learned a lot of new concepts and got to use callbacks, something that was still new to me.

##Learning Objectives
###Planning
This originally started off as a simple Bejeweled clone, and that was the first thing completed. Having written this project in a modular format, it was suggested that I add on another mini-game that communicates with the puzzle board. With a medieval movie playing in the background the idea of a dwarf walking to the tavern and encountering enemies along the way came to fruition. I've used simple sprites before with System.Drawing but this was new, adding in simple animations.

###Modularity
This is one of the few products that I have used a modular system for. I ejoyed trying it out, and I can see the convenience of modularity for a multi-faceted game that have many things going on at once but still need to communicate.

###Debugging / QA
One of the hardest things for project was check to see if orbs were matching, and having that match keep cascading until there are no more matches. Diaganal matches were some of the hardest to figure out, as I kept going out of bounds. Another thing that was complicated was figuring out if newly spawned orbs spawned into a matching formation, thus triggering a match.
